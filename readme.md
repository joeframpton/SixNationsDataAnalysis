### Data visualisations

The brief for this assignment was to source a dataset and visualise it in some way. I sourced the data from www.rugbypass.com using a webscraper. 

I then did an explority data analysis using Jupyter Notebook - these notes are quite rough. 

I then created a Dash App in Jupyter Notebook but noticed it was difficult to implement on other machines due to the dependencies installed, so I then ran it as a .py file instead. 

Running SixNationsAnalysis.py will launch a Dash Application which shows the visualisations.
