I wrote this script to scrape the data off RugbyPass.com

I manually copied each link using the javascript link scraper - I think I got this off the web so I can't claim it as my own work. I can't remember the source now though.

I haven't included the requirements to run the scraper in requirements.txt as I can't imagine you'll need or want to run in but I wanted to include is so you could see how the data was sourced.
